This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model for predicting real estate prices. Leveraging historical data on property features such as location, size, amenities, and local market trends, the model employs advanced regression techniques to forecast property prices accurately. By integrating data from various sources and utilizing state-of-the-art algorithms, the model offers valuable insights for both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions regarding real estate transactions. The project's ultimate goal is to provide a reliable tool that enhances transparency and efficiency in the real estate market, facilitating smoother transactions and better outcomes for all stakeholders involved.
